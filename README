I began this project with pseudo-coding my ideas. A bit ambitious at first, with 3 trivia categories, so I took it two steps back and focused on making one category work.

Installation instructions: Click the website (  http://hilarymasland.github.io/project1 ) and follow the link to "Hilary Trivia"

Be sure to capitalize the "T" or "F" in your answer or it will be counted as wrong.(also noted on the page)


User Stories:

1. If all of the answers are correct, the gif will change to a dancing Bugs Bunny!
2. Once a question is answered it is disabled.
3. If you click the "Hilary Trivia" link on the index page you are taken to a new HTML page.
4. Scores are collected after each question.
5. Score is totaled at the bottom of the page.
